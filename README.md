# Custom ERC-20 Token

## Overview

Welcome to the Custom ERC-20 Token repository! This project showcases a straightforward implementation of an ERC-20 token using Solidity, tailored for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC-20 standard defines a set of rules and functionalities that facilitate seamless interoperability between different decentralized applications (DApps) and Ethereum wallets.

## Features

- **ERC-20 Token Functionality**: The project includes essential ERC-20 token features, allowing for compatibility with a wide range of Ethereum-based applications.
- **Initial Token Supply**: An initial supply of 2000 tokens is set upon deployment, and you can easily customize the token name and symbol to suit the project.
- **Transaction Information Retrieval Functions**: Explore additional functionalities, such as retrieving the block timestamp of the latest transaction in a human-readable format, obtaining the address of the transaction sender, and identifying the address of the transaction receiver.
